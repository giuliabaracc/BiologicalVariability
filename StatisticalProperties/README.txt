In this folder, you'll find code to replicate the stats analyses. I uploaded only the local BOLD variability scripts, but the ones for global BOLD variability are the exact same (you just change the input data).
"RegionalStability_ofvariab_subjlevel.R" --> to assess stability/reliability of regional BOLD variability values
"NetworkStability_ofvariab_subjlevel.R" --> to assess stability/reliability of network BOLD variability values
