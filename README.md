# BiologicalVariability
Welcome to my rabbit hole! Here, you'll find the code I used in Baracchini et al., 2023 bioRxiv. 

This is this repo's structure:

[VariabQuantification](VariabQuantification/) is where you will find code to obtain local and global BOLD signal variability :)

[StatisticalProperties](StatisticalProperties/) is where you will find code to assess regional & network stability of local and global BOLD signal variability

[TemporalScales](TemporalScales/) is where you will find code to run 1/f and local variability simulations on MEG data
