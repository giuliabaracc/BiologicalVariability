# BiologicalVariability
Welcome to my rabbit hole! Here, you'll find the code I used in Baracchini et al., 2023 bioRxiv. 

This is this repo's structure:

'VariabQuantification/' is where you will find code to obtain local and global BOLD signal variability :)

'StatisticalProperties/' is where you will find code to assess stability and topography of local and global BOLD signal variability

'SpatialScales/' is where you will find code to obtain micro/meso/macroscale data & relate it to local and global BOLD signal variability

'TemporalScales/' is where you will find code to run 1/f and local variability simulations on MEG data
